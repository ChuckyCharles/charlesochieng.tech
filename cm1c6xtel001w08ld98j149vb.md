Multi-cloud strategy is a solution where organizations leverage two or many cloud service providers in optimization of their services and achievement of better services.

With the dominance of giant cloud service providers like AWS, Azure and Google, several organizations, in a bid to maximize their productivity have opted to utilize these providers in their multi-cloud adoption practice.

According to various reports , the percentage approximate of organizations using multi-cloud technology ranges between 80%-89% in 2024, proving a steady change from last year’s 70%. This upward trajectory gives insights into CloudChuck’s projected 94% adoption of the technology as at July,2025 with their main goal being business continuity and reduced downtime in service delivery. This has called for a quick need for multi-cloud skills among the cloud engineers and architects as observed in our semi-annual review of cloud infrastructure skills.
